I changed my idea to this endless runner inspired game where the player is a squid navigating
through the ocean. The player will find small fish to eat, while also evading
the sharks that will happily eat the player squid. I simply didn't find my original concept
that fun in practice, and my current favorite mobile game is an endless runner game.
